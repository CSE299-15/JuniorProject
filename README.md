# _THE NSU LOOP_


We aim to create a social media platform for connecting potential employers to connect with job-seekers online. We aim to connect people on the basis of trust through their mutual affiliation with North South University. The name of this social media platform will be THE_NSU_LOOP. The idea of the project is to promote a platform for NSU seniors & alumni to connect with each on a personal level for job placement opportunities.

Social media platforms have become very influential over the last decade & the popularities of various such platforms have exponentially increased. Acknowledging their ability to connect people, we decided to create a social media platform to specifically connect potential employers with job-seeking NSU seniors. This platform will enable only individuals with an NSU ID to register for their account & this will result in better confidence in users of the platform

The aim of the project is to create from scratch, an ad-supported web-based social media platform where users can share data in the form of text, photo, or video but in a limited capacity, with additional features of personal interaction & a more streamlined ad-free experience which can be unlocked & experiences behind a paywall. 
Benefits of this web application:
* NSU students can directly connect with NSU alumni
* Their mutual affiliation with NSU will build trust
* Academic documents & recommendation letters will be verified by our platform
Objective of this web application:
* Make the hiring process focused & easier around NSU students & graduates
