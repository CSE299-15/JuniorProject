# Documenting our Django project using the Sphinx tool

# Installing Sphinx
First we should enter the virtual environment for our Django project.
Installing Sphinx is quite straightforward using pip3 (pip for Python 3):
pip3 install sphinx

## Creating a documentation directory
Once we’ve installed Sphinx, we will need to create the document root folder. This folder will hold our documentation and other files we will need (images, about pages, and so on…).Create our document root folder in our project main folder and name it /docs.To start Sphinx, we run this command inside our /docs folder:
sphinx-quickstart
then we need to   connect our Django with it .

# About sphinx
